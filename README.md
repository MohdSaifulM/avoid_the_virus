<h1>PROJECT 1: THE GAME</h1> 

**Project title:** Avoid the virus!!!

I came out with the game concept of avoiding random obstacles and since we're all experiencing the pandemic why not
make it relatable. 

**The game includes the following:** <br>
1. Navigation from one screen to another without refreshing the page 
2. Using event listener to track the mouse position and placing the character on it 
3. Random spawning and movement of elements within the play area 
4. Collision detection of the random element and the player 
5. Added a power up which eliminates some of the elements when taken
6. Keeping track of the score and storing it in local storage
